      hdf5
        moved libraries to scratch0 on my afs
      collimat
        A bug I thought was fixed, when tct's
        doesn't have '.B' in their names
        they weren't discovered (tctv's in 2/8)
        fixed for all tct's with this commit

      hdf5
          some debug statements are now only printed if debug flag is used
          when running make_six
      collimat
          makedis_ga now using mynex/myney to set cut
      beamgas 
          cleaning up beamgas code somewhat


  SixTrack Version: 4.2.15 Yngve
    -- using make_six +option is not valid anymore 
       (cleaner make_six).
       Note, you use "./make_six option" to turn an option
       on, or "./make_six -option" to turn it off.
       
       for beamgas module, increased number of
       blocks/elements again. I had forgotten about
       that a while back...

       added gcc 4.6 to list of acceptable versions
       for hdf5
       
       removed Makefile, only Makefile.template
       should be part of repository. Makefile is generated
       by make_six
       
       added some fixes to make_six for hdf5/beamgas

  SixTrack Version: 4.2.15 Eric
    -- A few small changes for maintenance mainly.
       Extended Precision is disabled if crlibm is selected
       (was done by Lahey previously). Added the disable_xp routine to 
       crlibm and prototypes for both enable/disable_xp.
    -- beauty/count.awk now writes to count.log as well as 
       displaying report on the astuce directives in a .s file

      base for hdf5 lib/include folders.ylevinse46d 02h/trunk/SixTrack/
      96BEAMGAS source code
      This is the source code needed for the beamgas module.
      This patch is originating from many different commits on a different
      branch. Together with the previous commit the final code will be tested
      and checked before committed.ylevinse46d 02h/trunk/SixTrack/
      95HDF5 source code
      this commit contains the source code needed for HDF5 support.
      it is a copy of the diff from many other earlier commits on a different
      branch. There has been an attempt to clean it, so that the patches are
      easier to read.ylevinse46d 02h/trunk/SixTrack/

    C. Bracco / A. Rossi / Th. Weiler
    Changes in the collimation part:
    -- Added and updated alignment errors (tilt, offset,
       gap-size): all values of alignment errors can be kept

       been added and the inputs fort.3 adapted.
    -- Alignment errors are also applied for deformed jaws.
    -- Added to the pencil beam section the possibility to
       generate different particle distributions (Gaussian and
       rectangular in x and y) on the selected collimator.

       Modified crpoint,crcheck, and crstart and the size of the C/R file.
    -- If bnlelens, use napx rather napx00/npart for number of pairs
    -- Most important is that bnlens option is now an addition to the
       normal tracking so that the SAME executable can be used for
       normal DA and bnlelens LHC=9 runs (important for BOINC/CPSS)
       but LHC=9 does NOT write binary files nor post-process.

  SixTrack Version: 4.1.7 CVS Version 1.17 McIntosh
    -- make_six has a new 'debug' option to aid SixTrack development.
    -- If debug is selected, a new flag to ASTUTE SixTrack makes 
       available Unit 99 for messages and dumps and a set of dump 
       routines (of which only a full dump in this version).
    -- A  couple of write(* in SUBRE are now handled by C/R.
    -- A couple of bugs with C/R and IDFOR have been fixed.
    -- All subsequent changes noted here are for the 'bnlelens'
       and other SixTrack functionality should be unchanged
       (except that fort.95 and 96 are used for Checkpoint/Restart,
       C/R, instead of 12 and 13.)
    -- The bnlelens option has been implemented in comdecks bnlin and
       bnlout principally so it works for all six tracking routines.
       This has been tested only for THCK6D so far.
       There are now no changes to trauthck and trauthin.
    -- The C/R option for 6d and thick lens is disabled unless
       debug is selected.
    -- C/R now handles additional variables and correctly positions
       the beambeam-output.dat and beambeam-lostID.dat files.
    -- The binary files 90-59 are not used; no post-processing is
       performed. All OPEN/CLOSE have been moved to the standard comdecks
       and the variables moved to COMMON initialised by COMNUL.
    -- The READDIS routine for bnlelens is renamed to BNLRDIS to
       avoid confusion with collimation and it uses UNIT 54 to 
       read beambeamdist.dat which may now have only one sample.
    -- The n_cut and n_nocut variables are set to zero before the j loop.

     -- crlibm is cleaned up for Linux/Windows and logsix.dat and logsix.h are used
        instead of log.c and log.h and inlining is handled with an IFDEF.

        a common deck at the very beginning of sixtrack.s.
        Version is an 8 character string [v]v.[v]v.[v]v and
        moddate a 10 character string dd.mm.yyyy. The version is
        stored in floating-point in sumda(52) for BOINC in particular.
        In this way fort.10 identifies the version which produced it.
     -- Small format changes to a couple of comments and the SIXDA
        date/time corrected.

   Sixtrack Version ? CVS Revision 1.2 robertde
   Latest version of the expanded version for collimation studies (collimat flag)
     -- change of the collimator labels step to take into account the new Beam 2 lattice from MADX
     -- "STOP" flags have been checked and removed if necessary
     -- fort.XX units checked: no unit number above 99 shall be used
   GRD-SR 26/09/2006

  SixTrack Version: 4.0.08 
   Latest version of the expanded version for collimation studies (collimat flag)
     -- creation of 3 additive "makedis" subroutines, incl. one that allows to read any beam 
        distribution from a given input file
     -- correction of "bug" from previous RHIC version that added a fake aperture limitation of
        4 cm during tracking (particles over that amplitude were considered as absorbed)
     -- new treatment of collimator material: one can now simulate the flatness of any/both jaws 
        with fit parameters to be specified in the fort.3 file (COLLIMATION block)
   GRD-SR 20/10/2005

  SixTrack Version: 4.0.07 
  Version 1.3 make_six 05/09/2005 and Makefile updated

   (Should actually make a crlibm.s for crlibm with a Windows option)

  SixTrack Version: 4.0.05
   Latest version of the expanded version for collimation studies (collimat flag)
     -- creation of impact, absorption and FLUKA files

   Didn't touch SixTrack at all.
   Fixed comment and bug in make_six re naglib default.
   Created directory windows for crlibm for Windows.
   Added some options for cpss/windows to generate the
   src code and crlibm using the script mkwindows and 
   added checks for options.  Eric. 22/3/2005.
 
  SixTrack Version: 4.0.04
   Fix the problem with common blocks in sixda.f.
   Fix a small bug in dafor.f 
   Minor changes to make_six and Makefile.

  SixTrack Version: 4.0.03
   Completely new make_six to make SixTrack,(default), SixTrack_da (da) with crlibm/crlibm.a,
   Cernlib and Naglib.
   Options are: tilt tracking fast crlibm windows cernlib naglib da collimat cpss boinc cr nag g77
   Defaults are: tilt tracking fast crlibm cernlib naglib
   -option to delete it e.g -cernlib
   [+]option to activate e.g +cr for Checkpoint/Restart

   Uses the ast files in ast_mask
   e.g.
   make_six (defaults to tracking tilt fast crlibm cernlib)
   make_six collimat (does the same but with collimation)
   Supported compilers are lf95 (default) or NAG f95 or g77.
   Fixed a bug with crbinrecs in writebin in sixtrack.s

  SixTrack Version: 4.0.0
   Comments: Includes beam collimation, checkpoint/restart, and
             crlib options along with major code cleanup.

   Options: The following sub-directories, 
            ast_crcrlib ast_crlib ast_straight ast_tilt,
            contain the .ast files for building as follows:
            The straight/tilt builds without/with tilt.
            The crcrlib builds tilt with checkpoint/restart and crlib.
            The crlib builds tilt with crlib.
  
   Default: The .ast files in the current directory are for ast_crlib
            on SLC3 Linux at CERN. The crlibm routines in CRLIBOBJS.a
            are for Linux and have been compiled with lf95 6.2 and gcc 3.2.3.

   The following options are available (after copying the desired ast files
   to the current directory if non-default):

   makex clean

   makex sixtrack_vector_new

   makex sixtrack_da_new
